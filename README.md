# Learn Data Structure and Algorithm by grouped leetcode problems
## Goal
To facilitate programming learning and practical ability, we group [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems) problems into different collections by data structure and algorithm. Then it would relieve and strengthen ability as to concepts and coding ability of same type.

## Description
Currently, we have 12 collections
Data Structure:
* 1.array
* 2.string
* 3.stack
* 4.linkedList
* 5.binaryTree
* 6.graph
* 7.heap
* 8.queue
* 9.hashSetAndMap

Algorithm:
* binarySearch
* recursion
* sorting
